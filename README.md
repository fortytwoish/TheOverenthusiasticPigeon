# TheOverenthusiasticPigeon
I do monthly "Mini Game Jams" inspired by randomly generated prompts.

This will kick off monthly "Mini Game Jams" where I build little game concepts from randomly generated prompts.
Strongly inspired by Sebastian Lague's videos (https://www.youtube.com/user/Cercopithecan) whose prompt generator I'm also using.

Prompt for Game Jam #1 | March 2020

"A mix between the clicker and adventure game genres, where you play as an over-enthusiastic pigeon who needs to explore the world"
